I like reading classics -- they never disappoint. My all time favourite is 1984 by George Orwell. I used to be a big fan of Enid Blyton as a kid; someday childhood will return and I will read more of those gemstones. Until then, I'd like to buy:

- Midnight children by Salman Rushdie
- Inferno by Dante
- Ulysees by James Joyce
- War and peace by Leo Tolstoy
- Hitchhikers guide to the galaxy (all parts)
- La dame aux camilias by Alexandre Dumas *fils*
- Capital in 21st century by Thomas Piketty
- Inequalities of income by Thomas Piketty
- Fault Line: How Hidden Fractures Still Threaten the World Economy by Raghuram Rajan
- Saving Capitalism from the Capitalists by Raghuram Rajan

It has been a long while since Shakespeare, but it will be worth reading those again. This time I want to pay attention to slang and curse words of the Tudor era. I think I'll need a version where the original text is accompanied by modern English.

I also enjoy reading about political revolutionaries or satirists. Common sense by Thomas Paine is my favourte.

Feel free to gift me a paperback edition or suggest new books :)
