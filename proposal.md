##Scotty3D Visualization of Quantum Wave Functions

The goal of this project is to develop a meaningful and informative visualization of one dimensional wave functions and how they evolve in time in various potentials. 

The implementation of this visualization will largely be informed by our class discussion on solving discretized PDE's with numerical methods, and updating a mesh accordingly. The PDE at play is the 1D time-dependent Schrodinger equation 

\\(i\hbar \frac{\partial d}{\partial dt} \Psi(x,t) = \left( \frac{-\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2 + V(x,t))\right) \Psi(x,t)\\)


Here is an example of a visualization of a 1D quantum wave function. Notice that the animation gives information about the function's amplitude
