I am a graduate student studying scientific computation and physics-based simulation in the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. In 2016 I graduated from New York University with a BA in Mathematics and Computer Science. On this site, you can learn about my current and past research projects, publications, and education, as well as some blog posts and other interests.
