Hello! I am a CS PhD candidate at Cornell University concentrating in scientific computing. My research focuses on developing fast efficient algorithms based on analytic and algebraic methods to process linear systems arising from discretizing kernel functions in domains with very large amounts of data (for example, factoring million by million matrices). 

Since beginning my PhD I've also had the pleasure to spend two summers in ML-related software engineering at Google (2018 in LA, 2019 in Boston). In 2016 I graduated from NYU with a BA in Mathematics and Computer Science. I'm also halfway through training for my private pilot's license, a guitar and piano player, an avid cinephile, and a fan of road trips and skiing! On this site, you can learn about my current and past research, publications, projects, and education, as well as some blog posts and other interests.
