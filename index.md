Hello! I am a CS PhD student at Cornell University concentrating in scientific computing. In 2016 I graduated from NYU with a BA in Mathematics and Computer Science. On this site, you can learn about my current and past research projects, publications, and education, as well as some blog posts and other interests.  

Currently I am working on a machine learning project at Google in Los Angeles for the Summer of 2018. I will be back in Ithaca in September.
