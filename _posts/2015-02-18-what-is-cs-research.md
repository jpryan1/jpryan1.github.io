Today is the first anniversary of my PhD defense. Though I can legally call
myself a computer scientist but I have not earned the title just as yet.
But with this great power comes the great responsibility of answering an
interesting question to normal people and scientists from other disciplines:
what is computer science (CS) research?

I think theoretical CS people have an easier answer. They can legitimately
call themselves mathematicians who focus on topics that allow computers
to exist. Once you call yourself a mathematician no one will have a follow
up question. We applied CS researchers cannot call ourselves mathematicians
because we like building things that actually work. **We convert real world
problems into mathematics and then figure out how to solve them on a
computer**. But that is not easy to get across.

An important part of the problem is that most of the world does not
understand the difference between IT support, developers, applied researchers
and theoretical researchers. These are professionals with very different
skills, they find jobs in very different numbers in different
companies, and get very different salaries. But they are all labelled as
"computer people". This geeky artless description of the community of
engineers/scientists who make the modern world function is, in my opinion,
the root cause of a number of problems, including the lack of women in
CS (let's postpone this discussion for a later blog).

I have not spent any time thinking of a good answer but I did make
up a pathetic catch phrase when a non-science person asked me:

> If you know what you want to build can be built and if you also
> know how to build it, then it is labour. If you know what to build,
> that it can be built but don't know how, it is engineering. And
> if you don't know what to build, how to build and if it can be
> built but you probably know how to experiment, then it is research.
> If you know none of the above, it is management.

This is a one line conversation killer which might as well be
interpreted as "you are too dumb to understand; catch phrases suit you
better". An analogy I recently used for a biologist was:

> Pure research in chemistry and biochemistry does not mean that drug
> design is a trivial engineering problem. It involves lots of research
> including a fair amount of engineering. Applied CS is related to
> theory and mathematics in a very similar way.

Not that I am terribly proud of this analogy, but it is half a step better
than the previous. I am sure I can come up with similar analogies for
people in other disciplines. But is the best way of explaining our work?
Can we not come up with an absolute description, rather than relying on
analogies?

But even if I manage to resolve the above dilemma, I still do not know
how to face the real test - when my mother asks me "what is it that you do?".

*Hindsight: Even though we researchers consider ourselves most supportive
of gender equality, isn't it sexist that we colloquially use mothers/grandmothers
as the epitome of people who are completely naive about research. Our fathers
are none the wiser.*
