So the stage is set. If we have our metal plate, and we know what its boundary looks like (a square, a triangle, etc.), and we know what temperature the boundary must be (imagine the flat-irons keeping the temperature at the boundary constant), then we can solve Laplace's Equation to find out what the temperature distribution (\\(u(x)\\)) will be in steady state (imagine the coffee letting its heat into the room so that equilibrium is reached). Mathematically,

- we have a domain (the plate): \\(D\in R^2\\),
- a boundary (the plate's edges) \\(\partial D\in R^2\\), and we know 
- the temperature at the boundary: \\(u(x) = f(x)\\) for \\(x\in \partial D\\).
