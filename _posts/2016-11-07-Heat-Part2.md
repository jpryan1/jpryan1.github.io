So the stage is set. If we have our metal plate, and we know what its boundary looks like (a square, a triangle, etc.), and we know what temperature the boundary must be (imagine the flat-irons keeping the temperature at the boundary constant), then we can solve Laplace's Equation to find out what the temperature distribution will be in steady state. Mathematically,

- We have a domain (the plate): \\(D\in R^2\\),
- We have a boundary (the plate's edges) \\(\partial D\in R^2\\), 
- We have the temperature at the boundary: \\(u(x,y) = f(x,y)\\) for \\((x,y)\in \partial D\\),
- We are looking for \\(u(x,y)\\), the temperature at any point \\((x,y)\in D\\). This function solves \\(\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} = 0\\). 
    
    
_(side note: you'll notice that I'm writing \\(u(x,y)\\) instead of \\(u(x,y,t)\\) in this post. The reason is that I will be discussing the temperature distribution at steady state, wherein the temperature no longer depends on time.)_

To make things concrete, let's look at this steady state from the previous post:

In this image, our domain (plate) is every point \\((x,y)\\) where \\(0\leq x\leq 1\\) and \\(0\leq y\leq 1\\). Notice that this is a square subset of \\(R^2\\). Our boundary (plate's edges) is every point on the perimeter of the aforementioned square. 

Our temperature at the boundary is as follows: the left wall is 100 degrees, and the other walls are 70 degrees. To be a bit more mathy, we say that our temperature at the boundary is the function \\(f(x,y)\\) where 

- \\(f(x,y)=100\\) for \\(x=0\\) and \\(0\leq y\leq 1\\), and 
- \\(f(x,y)=70\\) for \\(x=1\\) and \\(0\leq y\leq 1\\), for \\(y=0\\) and \\(0\leq x\leq 1\\), and for \\(y=1\\) and \\(0\leq x\leq 1\\).

The point in writing out these boring details is to illustrate that we can capture the temperature at the boundary with the function \\(f(x,y)\\). 

The program that generated the above image approximated the solution Laplace's Equation with the input boundary conditions (the shape of the boundary and temperature along it) to find the temperature distribution in the plate. How did it do this? To find out, let us now talk about random things. 

Here are our goals

1. Define a random walk.
2. Discuss the expectation of a function of a random walk.
3. Use these tools to solve Laplace's equation.
4. Convert the above solution into an algorithm.

### What is a random walk?

Suppose you are on a giant checkerboard, and you are standing in a square. Suppose further that, to step from your square to an adjacent (not diagonal) square, you step a distance of 1 meter. The path that you take as you step from square to square in that checkerboard (wondering how you got there) is called a walk.

Now, instead of using your brain, imagine you walk randomly in the following way: at every second, you decide which adjacent square to step onto by picking a direction at random. Any direction has equal probability of being selected (you could decide what direction to go by drawing a card from a deck, and heading north if it's spades, south if it's hearts, and so on). Here's a picture of what that walk might look like:
