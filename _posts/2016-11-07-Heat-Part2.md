So the stage is set. If we have our metal plate, and we know what its boundary looks like (a square, a triangle, etc.), and we know what temperature the boundary must be (imagine the flat-irons keeping the temperature at the boundary constant), then we can solve Laplace's Equation to find out what the temperature distribution will be in steady state. Mathematically,

- We have a domain (the plate): \\(D\in R^2\\),
- We have a boundary (the plate's edges) \\(\partial D\in R^2\\), 
- We have the temperature at the boundary: \\(u(x,y) = f(x,y)\\) for \\((x,y)\in \partial D\\),
- We are looking for \\(u(x,y)\\), the temperature at any point \\((x,y)\in D\\)
    
    
_(side note: in my last post, I wrote _x_ as a 2D point, such as in _\\(x=(x_1,x_2)\\)_. In this post, I will be a bit more explicit, and write out both 2D coordinates. That is to say, _\\(u(x)\\)_ in my last post is the same thing as _\\(u(x,y)\\)_ in this post)._
To make things concrete, let's look at this steady state from the previous post:

In this image, our domain (plate) is every point \\((x,y)\\) where \\(0\leq x\leq 1\\) and \\(0\leq y\leq 1\\). Notice that this is a square subset of \\(R^2\\). Our boundary (plate's edges) is every point on the perimeter of the aforementioned square. 

Our temperature at the boundary is as follows: the left wall is 100 degrees, and the other walls are 70 degrees. To be just a _bit_ more mathy, we say that our temperature at the boundary is the function \\(f(x)\\) where \\(f(x)=100\\) for \\(x\\) on the left wall (d
